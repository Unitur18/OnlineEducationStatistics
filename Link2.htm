<h1>Will Higher Education Move Online?</h1>
<h4>by

In the U.S. and many other countries, the coronavirus pandemic has forced students of all ages to study from home. But is this such a bad thing – especially for older <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/829/college-and-university/" target="_blank"> students at universities</a> or other higher education institutions? A lot of the world’s citizen believe it’s not,<a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2020-11/higher-education-in-person-or-online.pdf" target="_blank">  according to a new survey by market research and consulting company Ipsos.</a>
<p>Globally, 23% of those surveyed in 29 countries think that within five years, higher education in their country will be carried out online in its entirety or in its majority, and 49% think online and in-person learning will be equally important in higher ed.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia had the most avid online students in the survey: 45% of respondent said that higher education will be delivered only (or mainly) online in five years, while 30 percent believed in an even split.</p>
<p>In most countries, the latter was the option believed to be most likely, with 64 percent in Chile and 63 percent in Mexico saying they thought online and in-person higher ed would see eye to eye five years down the line. Latin American countries favored this option most, with similar answers coming out of Brazil, Peru and Argentina.</p>
<p>European nations were a little more apprehensive about drastic changes in higher ed, while those in Asia could see online university becoming more of a thing the least.</p>
